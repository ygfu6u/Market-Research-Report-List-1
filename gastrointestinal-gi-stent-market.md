<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gastrointestinal / GI Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nitinol</li><li>Stainless Steel</li><li>Plastic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gastrointestinal (GI) stent market comprises three primary types: nitinol, stainless steel, and plastic stents. Nitinol stents are flexible and shape-memory, adapting to the body's movement, making them ideal for dynamic areas. Stainless steel stents are durable and provide robust support for strictures but may be less flexible. Plastic stents, while more cost-effective, are typically used for short-term applications due to their lower strength. Each type serves specific clinical needs based on the condition and location within the GI tract.</p></p>
