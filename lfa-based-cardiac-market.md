<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LFA-based Cardiac Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Troponin I</li><li>Troponin T</li><li>CK-MB</li><li>Myoglobin</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The LFA-based cardiac market focuses on rapid detection of cardiac biomarkers for diagnosing heart conditions. Troponin I and Troponin T are highly specific markers for myocardial injury, widely used in acute coronary syndrome. CK-MB, an enzyme marker, indicates heart muscle damage but is less specific than troponins. Myoglobin, an early marker, rises quickly post-injury but lacks specificity. Other markers include BNP and NT-proBNP for heart failure. LFA tests provide quick, portable, and cost-effective solutions for point-of-care cardiac diagnostics, enhancing timely treatment decisions.</p></p>
