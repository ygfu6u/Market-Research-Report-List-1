<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artemisinin Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Extraction From Artemisia Annua</li><li>Semisynthetic Artemisinin</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Artemisinin market is categorized into two primary types: extraction from Artemisia Annua and semisynthetic Artemisinin. Extraction from Artemisia Annua involves harvesting the plant's leaves to obtain the naturally occurring compound, which is then processed for pharmaceutical use, particularly in antimalarial treatments. Semisynthetic Artemisinin, on the other hand, involves chemical synthesis techniques to produce derivatives that mimic the natural compound. This method offers advantages in terms of supply consistency and cost-effectiveness, meeting the growing global demand for effective malaria treatments.</p></p>
