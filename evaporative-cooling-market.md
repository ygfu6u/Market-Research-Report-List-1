<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Evaporative Cooling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Evaporative Cooling</li><li>Indirect Evaporative Cooling</li><li>Two-stage Evaporative Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The evaporative cooling market comprises three main types: direct, indirect, and two-stage evaporative cooling. Direct evaporative cooling uses water to lower air temperature directly, ideal for arid climates. Indirect evaporative cooling separates the water and air streams, allowing for cooler air without adding humidity, suitable for various environments. Two-stage evaporative cooling combines both methods, enhancing efficiency and comfort by first pre-cooling the air before direct cooling, making it effective for larger spaces or varying climates.</p></p>
