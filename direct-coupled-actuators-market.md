<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Direct Coupled Actuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring Return Direct Coupled Actuators</li><li>Non-Spring Return Direct Coupled Actuators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The direct coupled actuators market is segmented into two main types: spring return and non-spring return actuators. Spring return direct coupled actuators utilize a spring mechanism to return to a default position when not powered, ensuring fail-safe operations in critical applications. In contrast, non-spring return direct coupled actuators rely solely on electrical power to maintain their position, offering more precise control without the limitation of a spring's actuation range. Both types serve various industrial automation needs efficiently.</p></p>
