<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Osteoporosis Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Antiresorptive Drugs</li><li>Anabolic Drugs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The osteoporosis drugs market comprises two primary types: antiresorptive drugs and anabolic drugs. Antiresorptive drugs work by slowing down bone resorption, thereby reducing the rate of bone loss. Common examples include bisphosphonates and selective estrogen receptor modulators. In contrast, anabolic drugs promote bone formation, increasing bone density and strength; examples include teriparatide and abaloparatide. Both types play crucial roles in managing osteoporosis, aiming to prevent fractures and enhance overall bone health in at-risk populations.</p></p>
