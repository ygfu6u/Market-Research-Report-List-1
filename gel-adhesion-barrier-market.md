<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gel Adhesion Barrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Gel Adhesion Barrier Market is segmented into two main types: absorbable and non-absorbable barriers. Absorbable barriers gradually degrade in the body, promoting healing while minimizing long-term complications. They are typically made from biocompatible materials that support tissue regeneration. Non-absorbable barriers, on the other hand, provide persistent separation of tissues to prevent adhesions over an extended period but may require surgical removal. Both types aim to reduce post-operative adhesions, enhancing patient recovery outcomes.</p></p>
