<p><strong>The Peristaltic Pumps for Chemical Processing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Roller Peristaltic Pump</li><li>Shoe type Peristaltic Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Peristaltic pumps are widely used in chemical processing for their ability to handle viscous, corrosive, or shear-sensitive fluids. There are two main types: roller peristaltic pumps and shoe-type peristaltic pumps. Roller peristaltic pumps use rollers to compress a hose, creating a positive displacement effect, making them ideal for high-pressure applications. Shoe-type peristaltic pumps utilize a shoe to achieve gentle fluid movement, which is better for delicate fluids. Both types ensure accurate flow rates and minimize contamination risks.</p></p>
