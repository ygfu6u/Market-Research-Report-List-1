<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neoantigen Cancer Vaccine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Personalized Vaccine</li><li>Off-the-shelf Neovaccines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The neoantigen cancer vaccine market consists of two primary types: personalized vaccines and off-the-shelf neovaccines. Personalized vaccines are tailored to an individual's unique tumor genetics, allowing for a customized immune response. These vaccines are developed using specific neoantigens derived from the patient's cancer cells. In contrast, off-the-shelf neovaccines are pre-manufactured, containing common neoantigens that can benefit a broader population. This approach offers more accessibility and quicker deployment, aiming to generate immune responses across various cancer types.</p></p>
