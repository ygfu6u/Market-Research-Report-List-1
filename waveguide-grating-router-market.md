<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Waveguide Grating Router Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Type</li><li>Athermal Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Waveguide grating routers (WGRs) are essential components in optical networks, enabling wavelength multiplexing and routing. The market can be divided into two primary types: thermal and athermal. Thermal type WGRs rely on temperature variations for wavelength tuning, making them sensitive to environmental changes but cost-effective. In contrast, athermal type WGRs maintain stability across temperature fluctuations, ensuring consistent performance. This stability comes at a higher cost, making athermal routers suitable for demanding applications in telecommunications and data centers.</p></p>
