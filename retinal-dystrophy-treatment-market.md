<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Retinal Dystrophy Treatment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gene Therapy Treatment</li><li>Symptomatic Treatment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The retinal dystrophy treatment market comprises two primary types: gene therapy and symptomatic treatment. Gene therapy focuses on addressing the underlying genetic causes of retinal dystrophies by introducing, removing, or altering genetic material within a patient's cells, aiming to restore vision or slow disease progression. In contrast, symptomatic treatment involves managing the symptoms and improving the quality of life for patients through methods such as visual aids, medications, and rehabilitation, without targeting the root genetic issues. Both approaches remain crucial in advancing care for affected individuals.</p></p>
